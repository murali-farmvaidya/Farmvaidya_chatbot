Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

These granules and liquid variants\nact as a vital conduit for plant sustenance. Within a mere gram or millilitre, a minimum of 10\nmycorrhizal spores is encapsulated. Highly effective Bio-encapsulation (patented technology)\nensures the availability of these Mycorrhiza variants in both granular and liquid states.\nBenefits:\n•Significantly improves absorption of phosphorus from the soil through its intricate root\nnetwork, fostering plant growth even in soils with diminished phosphorus levels.\n•Augments the population, contributing to enhanced nutrient uptake and overall plant vi-\ntality.\n•Acts as a shield, safeguarding plants from soil-borne diseases and resulting in healthier\ncrops.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 10 kg per acre for granular form, 5 litres per acre for liquid form.\n•Granular Form: Apply granules directly to the soil during final ploughing or when sowing\nseeds.\n•Liquid Form: Administer during the initial phase – either at planting or shortly thereafter.\n8\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: A single application during the cropping season is sufficient.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 1 to 2 times annually.\nCaution:\n•For granular form: Ensure thorough mixing during seedbed preparation.\n•For liquid form: Apply directly to roots during planting or shortly afterwards.\n3.3 N-Factor & P-Factor\n3.3.1 N-Factor – Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria\nN-Factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria that play a key role in stabilizing nitrogen\nin the environment. In one millilitre of liquid, a minimum of 1x10 bacteria is present. These\nbacteria, through release of various enzymes into the environment, convert atmospheric nitrogen\n(N) into immediately absorbable forms such as ammonia (NH) or nitrate (NO) for plants.\nBenefits:\n•Stabilizes 20 to 40 kg of nitrogen per hectare, significantly enhancing nitrogen availability.\n•Reduces need for chemical fertilizers by 25-30%.\n•Stimulates release of auxins, gibberellic acid, and cytokinins, fostering plant growth.\n•Improves moisture absorption capacity of plants from soil, resulting in 10-15% increase in\ncrop yield in rain-fed areas.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initially, apply through seed treatment using seed-dip method, followed by foliar spray\nduring subsequent stages.\n•In case of weather changes, apply 1 litre per acre as foliar spray.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.3.2 P-Factor – Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria\nThe P-Factor represents liquid living fertilizer, a potent blend of free-living and endophytic\nbacteria designed to unlock the power of phosphorus in neutral soil conditions. With a con-\ncentration of at least 1x10 bacteria per millilitre, this solution harnesses the natural ability of\nbacteria to solubilize phosphorus. Once applied, these bacteria seamlessly integrate into the\nsoil, releasing enzymes that dissolve inaccessible phosphorus and transform it into a readily\navailable form for plants.\n9\nBenefits:\n•Provides a substantial yield of 25–30 kg of phosphorus per hectare, reducing reliance on\nchemical fertilizers by 20–25%.\n•Stimulates secretion of specific hormones and bio-chemicals in the root region, fostering\nplant growth.\n•Results in a significant boost in crop yield (15–20%), contributing to sustainable and\nefficient agricultural practices.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initiate via drip irrigation initially, followed by strategic spraying during subsequent stages.\n•Apply during sowing or spraying for continuous release in crop root zone.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.4 K-FACTOR\nK-factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria in the rhizosphere, which are responsible\nfor mobilizing potassium in the soil. In one millilitre of fluid, there are at least 1x10 bacteria.\nThese bacteria, after entering the soil, release a variety of organic acids and enzymes into the\nroot zone. As a result, they facilitate the assimilation of potassium, making it more available\nto plants.\nAdvantages:\n•Improves potassium availability to plants from early stages, promotes strong root develop-\nment, stem and tuber formation. In addition, it contributes to increase the arrangement\nof flowers and fruits.\n•Reduces the need for chemical potassium fertilizers by 20-25%.\n•Exhibits antagonistic properties against various plant pathogens, contributes better disease\nresistance, improves plant vigor and yield.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 liter per acre.\n•Initially, apply by seed treatment using seedling dipping method, followed by foliar spray\nduring growth stages.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops, a single application per\n```",

These granules and liquid variants\nact as a vital conduit for plant sustenance. Within a mere gram or millilitre, a minimum of 10\nmycorrhizal spores is encapsulated. Highly effective Bio-encapsulation (patented technology)\nensures the availability of these Mycorrhiza variants in both granular and liquid states.\nBenefits:\n•Significantly improves absorption of phosphorus from the soil through its intricate root\nnetwork, fostering plant growth even in soils with diminished phosphorus levels.\n•Augments the population, contributing to enhanced nutrient uptake and overall plant vi-\ntality.\n•Acts as a shield, safeguarding plants from soil-borne diseases and resulting in healthier\ncrops.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 10 kg per acre for granular form, 5 litres per acre for liquid form.\n•Granular Form: Apply granules directly to the soil during final ploughing or when sowing\nseeds.\n•Liquid Form: Administer during the initial phase – either at planting or shortly thereafter.\n8\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: A single application during the cropping season is sufficient.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 1 to 2 times annually.\nCaution:\n•For granular form: Ensure thorough mixing during seedbed preparation.\n•For liquid form: Apply directly to roots during planting or shortly afterwards.\n3.3 N-Factor & P-Factor\n3.3.1 N-Factor – Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria\nN-Factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria that play a key role in stabilizing nitrogen\nin the environment. In one millilitre of liquid, a minimum of 1x10 bacteria is present. These\nbacteria, through release of various enzymes into the environment, convert atmospheric nitrogen\n(N) into immediately absorbable forms such as ammonia (NH) or nitrate (NO) for plants.\nBenefits:\n•Stabilizes 20 to 40 kg of nitrogen per hectare, significantly enhancing nitrogen availability.\n•Reduces need for chemical fertilizers by 25-30%.\n•Stimulates release of auxins, gibberellic acid, and cytokinins, fostering plant growth.\n•Improves moisture absorption capacity of plants from soil, resulting in 10-15% increase in\ncrop yield in rain-fed areas.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initially, apply through seed treatment using seed-dip method, followed by foliar spray\nduring subsequent stages.\n•In case of weather changes, apply 1 litre per acre as foliar spray.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.3.2 P-Factor – Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria\nThe P-Factor represents liquid living fertilizer, a potent blend of free-living and endophytic\nbacteria designed to unlock the power of phosphorus in neutral soil conditions. With a con-\ncentration of at least 1x10 bacteria per millilitre, this solution harnesses the natural ability of\nbacteria to solubilize phosphorus. Once applied, these bacteria seamlessly integrate into the\nsoil, releasing enzymes that dissolve inaccessible phosphorus and transform it into a readily\navailable form for plants.\n9\nBenefits:\n•Provides a substantial yield of 25–30 kg of phosphorus per hectare, reducing reliance on\nchemical fertilizers by 20–25%.\n•Stimulates secretion of specific hormones and bio-chemicals in the root region, fostering\nplant growth.\n•Results in a significant boost in crop yield (15–20%), contributing to sustainable and\nefficient agricultural practices.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initiate via drip irrigation initially, followed by strategic spraying during subsequent stages.\n•Apply during sowing or spraying for continuous release in crop root zone.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.4 K-FACTOR\nK-factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria in the rhizosphere, which are responsible\nfor mobilizing potassium in the soil. In one millilitre of fluid, there are at least 1x10 bacteria.\nThese bacteria, after entering the soil, release a variety of organic acids and enzymes into the\nroot zone. As a result, they facilitate the assimilation of potassium, making it more available\nto plants.\nAdvantages:\n•Improves potassium availability to plants from early stages, promotes strong root develop-\nment, stem and tuber formation. In addition, it contributes to increase the arrangement\nof flowers and fruits.\n•Reduces the need for chemical potassium fertilizers by 20-25%.\n•Exhibits antagonistic properties against various plant pathogens, contributes better disease\nresistance, improves plant vigor and yield.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 liter per acre.\n•Initially, apply by seed treatment using seedling dipping method, followed by foliar spray\nduring growth stages.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops, a single application per\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.
