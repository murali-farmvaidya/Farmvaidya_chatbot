These granules and liquid variants\nact as a vital conduit for plant sustenance. Within a mere gram or millilitre, a minimum of 10\nmycorrhizal spores is encapsulated. Highly effective Bio-encapsulation (patented technology)\nensures the availability of these Mycorrhiza variants in both granular and liquid states.\nBenefits:\n•Significantly improves absorption of phosphorus from the soil through its intricate root\nnetwork, fostering plant growth even in soils with diminished phosphorus levels.\n•Augments the population, contributing to enhanced nutrient uptake and overall plant vi-\ntality.\n•Acts as a shield, safeguarding plants from soil-borne diseases and resulting in healthier\ncrops.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 10 kg per acre for granular form, 5 litres per acre for liquid form.\n•Granular Form: Apply granules directly to the soil during final ploughing or when sowing\nseeds.\n•Liquid Form: Administer during the initial phase – either at planting or shortly thereafter.\n8\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: A single application during the cropping season is sufficient.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 1 to 2 times annually.\nCaution:\n•For granular form: Ensure thorough mixing during seedbed preparation.\n•For liquid form: Apply directly to roots during planting or shortly afterwards.\n3.3 N-Factor & P-Factor\n3.3.1 N-Factor – Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria\nN-Factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria that play a key role in stabilizing nitrogen\nin the environment. In one millilitre of liquid, a minimum of 1x10 bacteria is present. These\nbacteria, through release of various enzymes into the environment, convert atmospheric nitrogen\n(N) into immediately absorbable forms such as ammonia (NH) or nitrate (NO) for plants.\nBenefits:\n•Stabilizes 20 to 40 kg of nitrogen per hectare, significantly enhancing nitrogen availability.\n•Reduces need for chemical fertilizers by 25-30%.\n•Stimulates release of auxins, gibberellic acid, and cytokinins, fostering plant growth.\n•Improves moisture absorption capacity of plants from soil, resulting in 10-15% increase in\ncrop yield in rain-fed areas.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initially, apply through seed treatment using seed-dip method, followed by foliar spray\nduring subsequent stages.\n•In case of weather changes, apply 1 litre per acre as foliar spray.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.3.2 P-Factor – Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria\nThe P-Factor represents liquid living fertilizer, a potent blend of free-living and endophytic\nbacteria designed to unlock the power of phosphorus in neutral soil conditions. With a con-\ncentration of at least 1x10 bacteria per millilitre, this solution harnesses the natural ability of\nbacteria to solubilize phosphorus. Once applied, these bacteria seamlessly integrate into the\nsoil, releasing enzymes that dissolve inaccessible phosphorus and transform it into a readily\navailable form for plants.\n9\nBenefits:\n•Provides a substantial yield of 25–30 kg of phosphorus per hectare, reducing reliance on\nchemical fertilizers by 20–25%.\n•Stimulates secretion of specific hormones and bio-chemicals in the root region, fostering\nplant growth.\n•Results in a significant boost in crop yield (15–20%), contributing to sustainable and\nefficient agricultural practices.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 litre per acre.\n•Initiate via drip irrigation initially, followed by strategic spraying during subsequent stages.\n•Apply during sowing or spraying for continuous release in crop root zone.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops: Single application per crop cycle.\n•For mid-duration crops: Apply twice.\n•For long-duration crops: Apply 2 to 3 times per crop cycle.\n3.4 K-FACTOR\nK-factor refers to free-living or endophytic bacteria in the rhizosphere, which are responsible\nfor mobilizing potassium in the soil. In one millilitre of fluid, there are at least 1x10 bacteria.\nThese bacteria, after entering the soil, release a variety of organic acids and enzymes into the\nroot zone. As a result, they facilitate the assimilation of potassium, making it more available\nto plants.\nAdvantages:\n•Improves potassium availability to plants from early stages, promotes strong root develop-\nment, stem and tuber formation. In addition, it contributes to increase the arrangement\nof flowers and fruits.\n•Reduces the need for chemical potassium fertilizers by 20-25%.\n•Exhibits antagonistic properties against various plant pathogens, contributes better disease\nresistance, improves plant vigor and yield.\nDosage & Application:\n•Dosage: 1 liter per acre.\n•Initially, apply by seed treatment using seedling dipping method, followed by foliar spray\nduring growth stages.\nApplication Frequency:\n•For short-duration crops, a single application per",

Scientific rationale: Fermentation ensures faster nutrient uptake. Success stories:\nFarmers in Telangana observed 20–25% higher yield and stronger roots after repeated use.\n5 Biofactor’s chemical fertilizers:\nToday the agricultural sector is facing harsher and more unpredictable weather conditions than\never before. Similarly, the soil’s nutrient capacity and microbial population are reduced. Al-\nthough farmers use traditional chem ical fertilizers found in the market, the nutrient availability\nand utilization efficiency of plants has decreased due to the high particle size of these nutrients.\nTo overcome these problems, Biofactor has developed the Microbe Metabolite Assisted Micron\nSized Par ticles (MAMSP) technology, which uses microbes to microsize the particle size. All\nthe products made using this technology have very small sized of nutrients. Thus the availability\nand utilization efficiency of nutrients to plants increases. They work with three times higher\nefficiency compared to regular fertilizers. Therefore the biofactor can get more results using less\nquantity of their chemical nutrients\nPOTASSIUM THIOSULPHATE - 25% A liquid nutrient mixture that provides potassium.\nIt contains 25% potash as well as calcium, boron and manganese required for flowering and\nfruiting de velopment. Formulated using MAMS (Microbe Assisted Microsize Particle) tech\nnology.Thereby increasing nutrient availability and utilization efficiency.After use of High-K\nSugar content in fruits increases and fruit pulp enhances due to which fruit gets more sweetened\nget more shining and gaining more weight that im proves quality of fruit.\n19\nAdvantages:\n•Spraying during the flowering stage helps in healthy flowers (more female f lowers) and\nmore pollination.\n•Spraying at the pod stage contributes to more pod formation, more harvests, less pod drop,\nmore seeds in pods formed and higher quality\n•Increases resistance to insects and pests. Helps to withstand water stress.\nDosage:\n•Spray method 500 - 800 ml/acre (2.5-4.0 ml/liter of water)\nApplication:\n•Give the plants by spraying or drip irrigation during flowering stage, pod growth and\nfruiting stages.\nFrequency:\n•Spray or drip irrigation - once every 7-10 days\n5.0.1 CHELATED ZINC AS ZINC GLYCINE (LIQUID)\nLiquid nutrient mixture providing zinc nutrient (6.8%).

Lifespan:  Shorter  economic  life,  usually  30  to  60  years.  4.  Pollination:  Mostly  self-pollinated,  leading  to  uniform  offspring.  5.  Adaptability:  Generally  less  hardy,  can  be  more  susceptible  to  drought  and  certain  \ndiseases.\n 6.
